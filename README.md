# Avrioc Assignment

## Points I want to address
- It is my first time interaction with typescript
- It is my first time interaction with NestJs
- I am writing this assignment while sitting in a hospital as my grandfather is seriously ill

### Features
- Winston Logging
- swagger for backend api documentation
- Test cases using jest
- Dockerisation

### What's not included
- No Frontend Framework / HTML code included as I'm a complete backend dev with no/little knowledge of them

### Installation
> If You have docker && docker compose installed
```
docker-compose up
```
> Else
```
git clone git@github.com:amulyakashyap09/avrioc.git
cd avrioc
npm start
```

> Visit http://localhost:3000/swagger for the api specifications

Thanks
